Next Steps - 
		
	Account / Manage

		- Registration (need to duplicate it on mobile site)
		- Send email - good, need to duplicate on mobile
		- Confirm email - good, need to duplicate on mobile		
		- Forgot Username page
			- enter email, verify and send username to email (Done) (need to duplicate on mobile)
			- or
			- enter phone, SMS verify, and display username on screen (Done) (need to duplicate on mobile)

		- Manage Account Page
			- Disable two-factor not working
			- Add change username, email, last/first name, optional fields

		- SendCode page
			- only using phone, remove drop down, potentially remove entire page, just send code and wait for verification



		



		*** Look into updating claims, and cleaning up duplicate claims (fullname) 
			(add claim in registration (done) and if names are changed in manage, do a claims delete, claims add)
			


		- Logon, manage, need to duplicate on mobile site
		- Registration, logon, manage, need to clean up look of pages

		
		- Logon Page
			*** Test and figure out where/why fullname isn't showing up in nav bar, and fix that'

		- Development Controller/Development Home Page - if logon fails, display message back at development home


		- Password reset
			*** Using sendgrid templated email


			Decisions: 
				1. Forgot username, enter email, if found, email username to that address (low risk)
				1a. Forgot username, if 2 factor set up, confirm phone with code, once code displayed, show username.
				2. Forgot password, enter email.  if found, email link for password reset.  If 2 factor set up, link will
				come to SMS confirmation page - enter phone number, then code 780-***-**01



					
		- Manage Account 
			*** Profile details (need to re-establish full-name claim if name is changed)
			*** Change Password
			*** Change username, custom profiles

		
		Company Admin Custom Profile Details


	iPad Functionality
		*** Build mobile page view
		*** Ensure logon works on mobile page
		

		- select lists not displaying properly
		- company self-registration email input prepend and append not showing correctly
		- company and group table not looking right, need to compact a little bit to display better


	Users
		- Build user list page
		- build add user page
		- build delete user page
		- build edit user page
		- build group membership / role access page (? view role access and source in edit user page)
		- build administer custom profile fields page
		- update my profile page to include custom fields
		- do some testing of adding / removing group membership, and group roles, and make sure members
				maintain the roles / change roles appropriately.  Easier to do once user-roles are visible

	Company
		- Test that when module access is denied, any users or groups with role access within that module
		 loose that access - they should, the delete function is built into the sproc, just need to test it


	Overall


*** Add version 3 improvement details to About page as built



****** Training Mode Thoughts ********

Only certain areas will be enabled for write/edit/delete in training mode.  check sheets, fuel entry, work order will be allowed
reports, asset/lists/ admin will be view only
will have tbCheckSheet_CheckSheetRecordsTRAINING tables for those areas where write is permitted, and worker will periodically clean
those tables


******* Publish Notes ************

*   right click eCheck3 project, select publish

* for DB, use EMSDataLocal, and EMSDataLive [Once this is working, delete EMSData on Local server, and EMSData_db on live]

****** General User Notes *******

* (ASPUsers.ID is a primary key - Use UserID rather than username as FK) - OK

To build labels for CRUD functionality that withstand updates, put the labels in the MetaData.cs, and link the 
model to the labels in PartialClasses.cs

To change a model, right click the model in the diagram, and go to update model from database.
  Add/remove tables, sprocs, views, etc from there

Go to controllers, right click, add new controller, MVC Scaffolded, same name as existing. 
 Just save any essential changes to controller or view prior to updating the scaffold

To change a stored procedure, delete it in the database
then delete it in the model, go to model view from the edmx file, and delete
the function imports and complex types.  Then re-add it in the database, and add
it to the model by updating from database 

Still need to include "Factory = 'System.ServiceModel.Activation.WebServiceHostFactory'" in WCF Service.svc file
To build a service add a WCF Service (not the AJAX enabled)

To Write to debug window
  System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("New ID: " + ext_tbCompany_Company.ID);
