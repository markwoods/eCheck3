****** Training Mode Thoughts ********

Only certain areas will be enabled for write/edit/delete in training mode.  check sheets, fuel entry, work order will be allowed
reports, asset/lists/ admin will be view only
will have tbCheckSheet_CheckSheetRecordsTRAINING tables for those areas where write is permitted, and worker will periodically clean
those tables


******* Publish Notes ************

*   right click eCheck3 project, select publish

* for DB, use EMSDataLocal, and EMSDataLive [Once this is working, delete EMSData on Local server, and EMSData_db on live]

****** General User Notes *******

* (ASPUsers.ID is a primary key - Use UserID rather than username as FK) - OK

To build labels for CRUD functionality that withstand updates, put the labels in the MetaData.cs, and link the 
model to the labels in PartialClasses.cs

To change a model, right click the model in the diagram, and go to update model from database.
  Add/remove tables, sprocs, views, etc from there

Go to controllers, right click, add new controller, MVC Scaffolded, same name as existing. 
 Just save any essential changes to controller or view prior to updating the scaffold
